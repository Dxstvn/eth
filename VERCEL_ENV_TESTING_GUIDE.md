# Vercel Environment Variables Testing Guide

## Current Status ✓

Your Firebase environment variables are properly configured in Vercel as shown in the screenshot. The fact that Google Sign-In works in production confirms everything is set up correctly.

## Why Local Shows "Not Set"

When running `npm run dev` locally, your app doesn't have access to Vercel's environment variables. This is by design for security - Vercel keeps your production secrets safe.

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Test on Vercel Preview/Production (Recommended)
Since your environment variables are already working in Vercel:
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically create a preview deployment
3. Test on the preview URL or production URL

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI (For Local Testing)
If you need to test with production environment variables locally:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Link to your Vercel project
vercel link

# Pull environment variables to .env.local
vercel env pull .env.local

# Run locally with production env vars
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Create Test Environment Variables
For development only (not recommended for production secrets):

1. Create `.env.local` with test values
2. Add to `.gitignore` (should already be there)
3. Use different Firebase project for local development

## Verifying Your Setup

Your setup is working correctly if:
- ✅ Google Sign-In works on your Vercel deployment
- ✅ No Firebase errors in production console
- ✅ `/test-env` page shows all green on Vercel deployment

## Security Note

Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing real environment variables to Git. Vercel's environment variable system is designed to keep your secrets safe.

## Conclusion

Your current setup is correct and secure. The local "not set" status is expected behavior and doesn't indicate any problems with your production deployment.
