## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to fully integrate the ClearHold frontend with the updated backend API. The integration will replace all mock/simulated functionality with real backend services, ensuring production-ready implementation that follows ClearHold brand design principles.

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Gaps
1. **URL Inconsistency**: Different services use different backend URLs
2. **Mock Implementations**: Several core features using simulated data
3. **Missing Real-time Updates**: No Firestore listeners implemented
4. **Incomplete API Coverage**: Some backend endpoints not implemented in frontend
5. **File Storage**: Using mock IPFS instead of Firebase Storage
6. **Cross-chain Support**: Limited implementation of multi-chain features

## Appendix: Code Examples

### API Client Example
```typescript
class ApiClient {
  private baseUrl: string;
  private auth: Firebase.Auth;

  async request<T>(
    method: string,
    endpoint: string,
    data?: any,
    options?: RequestOptions
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<T>> {
    try {
      const token = await this.auth.currentUser?.getIdToken();
      const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}${endpoint}`, {
        method,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
          ...options?.headers
        },
        body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
        ...options
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new ApiError(response.status, await response.text());
      }

      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleError(error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### React Hook Example
```typescript
export function useTransaction(id: string) {
  const [transaction, setTransaction] = useState<Transaction | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = subscribeToTransaction(id, {
      onUpdate: (data) => setTransaction(data),
      onError: (err) => setError(err),
      onLoading: (isLoading) => setLoading(isLoading)
    });

    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [id]);

  return { transaction, loading, error };
}
```
