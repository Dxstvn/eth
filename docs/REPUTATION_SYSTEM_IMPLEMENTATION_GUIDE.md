# ClearHold Reputation System Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide consolidates the comprehensive planning for ClearHold's reputation score system, which integrates with the dispute resolution mechanism and staking requirements. The system is designed to deter bad behavior, encourage honest transactions, and build trust within the platform.

## System Overview

### Core Components

1. **Reputation Score Calculation**
   - Transaction Score (40%): Successful deals, transaction volume, diversity
   - Dispute Resolution Score (30%): Honesty in disputes, resolution time
   - Stake & Commitment Score (20%): Staked amount, time locked
   - Community Feedback Score (10%): Peer reviews, endorsements

2. **Reputation Levels**
   - **Unverified** (0-199): New users, limited features
   - **Bronze** (200-499): $100 stake, $10K transaction limit
   - **Silver** (500-749): $500 stake, $50K limit, 10% fee discount
   - **Gold** (750-899): $2,000 stake, $250K limit, 20% discount
   - **Platinum** (900+): $10,000 stake, unlimited, 30% discount

### Key Features

- **Visual Representation**: Badges, shields, progress bars
- **Trust Indicators**: Real-time scores during transactions
- **Reputation Gates**: Feature access based on level
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Responsive design for all devices
- **Anti-Gaming Measures**: Sybil detection, collusion prevention

## Implementation Architecture

## Security Model

### Threat Mitigation

1. **Sybil Attacks**
   - KYC verification required
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - IP and behavior analysis

2. **Collusion Prevention**
   - Graph analysis for circular trading
   - Reciprocal transaction detection
   - Network-wide penalties
   - Timing correlation analysis

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Merkle tree proofs
   - Cryptographic signatures
   - Immutable event logging
   - Cross-verification systems

### Staking Mechanism

#### Progressive Requirements
- Bronze: $100 (1-month lock)
- Silver: $500 (3-month lock)
- Gold: $2,000 (6-month lock)
- Platinum: $10,000 (12-month lock)

#### Slashing Rules
- False disputes: 10-50% slash
- System gaming: 25-75% slash
- Repeat violations: 100% slash + ban
- Appeal mechanism available

## Testing Strategy

### Coverage Requirements
- Overall: 85% minimum
- Critical paths: 95% minimum
- Security functions: 100% required

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Component and function level
2. **Integration Tests**: System interactions
3. **Security Tests**: Attack simulations
4. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
5. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journeys

### Performance Benchmarks
- Single reputation query: < 100ms
- Bulk updates: < 500ms for 100 events
- Real-time calculations: < 20ms
- System capacity: 1000+ updates/second

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
1. **Authentication**: KYC bonus for verified users
2. **Transactions**: Real-time score updates
3. **Disputes**: Automatic reputation adjustments
4. **Wallets**: On-chain reputation tracking

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Reputation Query
GET /api/reputation/:userId
GET /api/reputation/:userId/history
GET /api/reputation/:userId/breakdown

// Reputation Updates
POST /api/reputation/events
PUT /api/reputation/:userId/verify

// Staking Operations
POST /api/staking/stake
POST /api/staking/unstake
GET /api/staking/:userId/status
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Average reputation scores by level
- Dispute resolution impact on scores
- Stake participation rates
- Gaming attempt detection rate
- User retention by reputation level

### Alerts
- Sudden score drops (> 20%)
- Sybil attack patterns
- Collusion detection
- System performance degradation
- Security violations

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always validate reputation events
2. Use rate limiting for all endpoints
3. Log all reputation-affecting actions
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Follow security guidelines

### For Users
