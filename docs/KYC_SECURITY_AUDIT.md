# [SECURITY] KYC Implementation Security Audit Report

**Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Team  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL

---

## Executive Summary

This security audit evaluated the KYC (Know Your Customer) implementation for the ClearHold platform, focusing on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, encryption strength, authentication mechanisms, and compliance requirements. The audit found a generally robust security implementation with strong encryption, comprehensive input validation, and multiple layers of defense. However, several areas require immediate attention to address potential vulnerabilities.

### Key Findings Summary
- **Critical Issues**: 1 (Session encryption using deprecated crypto functions)
- **High Severity**: 3 (CSRF implementation gaps, missing security headers, rate limiting bypass)
- **Medium Severity**: 5 (Input validation edge cases, file upload restrictions, session management)
- **Low Severity**: 8 (Logging practices, error messages, documentation)

### Overall Security Score: B+ (85/100)

## 1. Vulnerability Findings by Severity

### 1.1 CRITICAL Severity Findings

#### VULN-001: Deprecated Crypto Functions in Session Management
**Component**: `/lib/security/kyc-session.ts` (lines 166-177)  
**CVSS Score**: 9.1 (Critical)  
**CWE**: CWE-327 (Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)

**Description**: The session encryption uses deprecated `crypto.createCipher` and `crypto.createDecipher` functions which use weak key derivation and no IV.

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
function encryptSessionId(sessionId: string): string {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', SESSION_SECRET)
  // ...
}
```

**Impact**: Session tokens can be vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks and pattern analysis.

**Remediation**: Replace with `crypto.createCipheriv` and `crypto.createDecipheriv` with proper IV generation:
```typescript
function encryptSessionId(sessionId: string): string {
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16)
  const key = crypto.scryptSync(SESSION_SECRET, 'salt', 32)
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, iv)
  let encrypted = cipher.update(sessionId, 'utf8', 'hex')
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex')
  return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + encrypted
}
```

### 1.2 HIGH Severity Findings

#### VULN-002: Incomplete CSRF Protection Implementation
**Component**: `/app/api/kyc/personal/route.ts` and middleware  
**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)  
**CWE**: CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Description**: While CSRF token validation exists, the implementation has gaps:
1. No automatic CSRF token generation and injection in forms
2. CSRF tokens not tied to user sessions properly
3. Missing double-submit cookie pattern implementation

**Impact**: Potential for CSRF attacks on state-changing operations.

**Remediation**:
1. Implement double-submit cookie pattern
2. Auto-inject CSRF tokens in all forms
3. Validate token binding to session

#### VULN-003: Missing Critical Security Headers
**Component**: `/middleware.ts`  
**CVSS Score**: 7.0 (High)  
**CWE**: CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)

**Description**: Several important security headers are missing:
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`: Missing for API routes
- `Expect-CT`: Not configured for certificate transparency
- `Feature-Policy`: Using deprecated `Permissions-Policy` only

**Impact**: Reduced defense against various client-side attacks.

**Remediation**: Add missing headers to middleware.

#### VULN-004: Rate Limiting Bypass via IP Spoofing
**Component**: `/middleware.ts` (lines 17-27)  
**CVSS Score**: 6.5 (High)  
**CWE**: CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing)

**Description**: Rate limiting relies on client-provided headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`) which can be spoofed.

**Impact**: Attackers can bypass rate limiting by manipulating headers.

**Remediation**: 
1. Use a combination of multiple factors for client identification
2. Implement distributed rate limiting with Redis
3. Add behavioral analysis beyond simple request counting

---

### 1.3 MEDIUM Severity Findings

#### VULN-005: Insufficient File Type Validation
**Component**: `/lib/security/kyc-security.ts`  
**CVSS Score**: 5.3 (Medium)  
**CWE**: CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous File Type)

**Description**: File validation only checks MIME type and extension, not actual file content/magic bytes.

**Impact**: Potential for uploading malicious files disguised as allowed types.

**Remediation**: Implement magic byte validation:
```typescript
const MAGIC_BYTES = {
  'image/jpeg': [0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF],
  'image/png': [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47],
  'application/pdf': [0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46]
}
```

**Component**: `/lib/security/kyc-encryption.ts`  
**CVSS Score**: 4.8 (Medium)  
**CWE**: CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements)

**Description**: No enforcement of strong passwords for encryption keys.

**Impact**: Weak passwords reduce encryption effectiveness.

**Remediation**: Implement password strength validation with entropy checks.

#### VULN-008: Missing Content-Type Validation
**Component**: Request validation middleware  
**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Medium)  
**CWE**: CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)

**Description**: API endpoints don't strictly validate Content-Type headers.

**Impact**: Potential for content-type confusion attacks.

**Remediation**: Strictly validate Content-Type for all endpoints.

#### VULN-009: Insufficient Logging of Security Events
**Component**: Throughout the application  
**CVSS Score**: 4.0 (Medium)  
**CWE**: CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging)

**Description**: Security events are not consistently logged with sufficient detail.

**Impact**: Reduced ability to detect and investigate security incidents.

**Remediation**: Implement comprehensive security event logging.

**Component**: External resource loading  
**CVSS Score**: 2.5 (Low)  
**CWE**: CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check)

**Description**: External scripts loaded without SRI hashes.

**Remediation**: Add integrity attributes to all external resources.

**Component**: Client-side encryption  
**CVSS Score**: 2.0 (Low)  
**CWE**: CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions)

**Description**: No fallback for browsers without crypto API support.

**Remediation**: Add compatibility checks and graceful degradation.
