# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Agent Capabilities & Behavioral Principles

You are a full-stack software engineer with comprehensive expertise in:
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt.js, Angular, Svelte
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS, SCSS, styled-components
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, NestJS, Python, Django, FastAPI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Firestore
- **Cloud**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Vercel, Netlify
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, GitHub Actions
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js, Web3.js, Solidity, Smart Contracts

### Core Behavioral Principles
1. **Constant Evaluation**: Before each action, assess if it's the optimal and safest approach
2. **Task Focus**: Never stray from the current task; maintain clear focus on objectives
3. **Safety First**: Prioritize code safety, security best practices, and data integrity
4. **Incremental Progress**: Make small, testable changes rather than large, risky modifications
5. **Verification**: Always verify changes work as expected before moving to next step
6. **Documentation**: Keep code well-documented and maintain clear commit messages
7. **Progress Tracking**: ALWAYS update plan/tracking files when completing tasks:
   - When completing a phase/task in any plan document, mark it as ✓ COMPLETED
   - Update status, dates, and any relevant notes in planning documents
   - Keep BACKEND_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md and similar files current with actual progress
   - Example: Phase 1.1 ✓ COMPLETED - 2025-01-20

## Project Overview

ClearHold is a blockchain-powered escrow platform for real estate and high-value asset transactions. Currently in simulation/prototype phase with functional UI but mock blockchain interactions.

## Backend Integration Goal

The backend repository has been cloned to `/backend/` directory. The primary objective is to fully integrate the frontend with this backend, replacing all mock implementations with real API calls. The backend provides:

### Backend API Structure (from `/backend/`)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with JWT tokens (`/src/api/auth.js`)
- **Wallet Management**: Multi-wallet support (`/src/api/wallet.js`)
- **Transaction/Deals**: Escrow deal management (`/src/api/deal.js`)
- **Contacts**: Contact invitation system (`/src/api/contact.js`)
- **Files**: Document management (`/src/api/files.js`)
- **Smart Contracts**: Blockchain integration (`/src/contract/`)

### Integration Priorities
1. Replace mock authentication with backend Firebase auth
2. Connect wallet management to backend endpoints
3. Integrate real transaction/deal management
4. Implement file upload to Firebase Storage (not IPFS)
5. Add real-time updates via Firestore listeners
6. Ensure all UI follows brand design principles

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                          # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)

# Testing
npm test                            # Run all tests
npm run test:watch                  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage               # Generate coverage report

# Integration Testing
npm run firebase:emulators          # Start Firebase emulators (required for some tests)
npm run test:integration:backend    # Test against staging backend
npm run test:integration:firebase   # Test with Firebase emulators
npm run test:integration:context    # Test auth context integration

# Build & Lint
npm run build                       # Build for production
npm run lint                        # Run ESLint
```

### Running Single Tests
```bash
npm test -- path/to/test.test.tsx   # Run specific test file
npm test -- -t "test name"          # Run tests matching name
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **State Management**: React Context API, Zustand
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth via backend API
- **Backend**: Custom API at `api.clearhold.app`
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for documents
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js (currently simulated)

### Key Architecture Patterns

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Backend handles Firebase auth, returns tokens
   - AuthContext manages token lifecycle
   - Automatic token refresh 5 minutes before expiry
   - API client auto-injects Bearer tokens

2. **Directory Structure**
   - App Router with route groups: `(dashboard)`, `(marketing)`
   - Feature-based organization
   - UI components in `/components/ui/`
   - Business logic in `/context/` and `/services/`

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Jest + React Testing Library
   - Comprehensive mocks for Firebase, localStorage, APIs
   - Integration tests for backend and Firebase emulators
   - Target: 80%+ coverage for critical paths

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Token Management**
   - Tokens stored in localStorage with `clearhold_auth_token` key
   - Refresh handled by `scheduleTokenRefresh` in auth-context
   - API calls use `apiClient` wrapper for automatic auth

2. **Transaction Flow**
   - Two-stage process: initiation → completion
   - Supports seller-initiated and buyer-initiated flows
   - Status tracking through comprehensive lifecycle
   - Documents uploaded to Google Cloud Storage

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Multi-wallet support via wallet-context
   - Network detection service for chain validation
   - Mock wallet service available for testing

### Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*              # Firebase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLOUD_*          # GCS configuration
```

### Important Notes

- **Build Configuration**: ESLint and TypeScript errors are ignored during builds
- **Simulation Mode**: Blockchain interactions are currently mocked
- **Brand Update**: Recently rebranded IPFS references to "Cloud Storage"
- **API Endpoint**: Using staging environment, not production

## Backend Integration Guidelines

### API Client Usage
When integrating with backend, always:
1. Check `/backend/src/api/` for exact endpoint structure
2. Verify request/response formats in backend code
3. Use proper error handling for all API calls
4. Implement loading states and user feedback

### Testing Integration
1. Test with Firebase emulators first
2. Verify against staging backend
3. Write integration tests for each endpoint
4. Ensure backwards compatibility during migration

### Safety Checks
Before making changes:
1. ✓ Is this the safest approach?
2. ✓ Have I verified the backend endpoint exists?
3. ✓ Will this break existing functionality?
4. ✓ Are proper error boundaries in place?
5. ✓ Does the UI follow brand guidelines?

### Incremental Migration Strategy
1. Keep mock implementations alongside real ones
2. Use feature flags to toggle between mock/real
3. Migrate one service at a time
4. Verify each service works before moving on
5. Remove mocks only after full verification
