## Running the Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test DocumentUploadStep.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific E2E test
npx playwright test document-upload.spec.ts

# Run E2E tests in UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Run E2E tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Test Data and Mocks

### Mock Files Used in Tests
- **Valid Files:** JPEG, PNG, PDF with appropriate MIME types
- **Invalid Files:** TXT, EXE files for validation testing
- **Large Files:** Files over 10MB for size validation
- **Test User:** Mock authenticated user with ID `test-uid`

### Key Mocks
- `useAuth`: Returns mock user object
- `useRouter`: Mocks navigation functions
- `SecureFileUpload`: Mocked in parent component tests
- `FileReader`: Mocked for image preview functionality
- `Canvas`: Mocked for watermark testing

## Coverage Thresholds

Based on the `vitest.config.ts`:
- **Branches:** 80%
- **Functions:** 80%
- **Lines:** 80%
- **Statements:** 80%

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **File Validation:**
   - Unsupported file types
   - Files exceeding size limit
   - Empty file uploads

2. **Document Recency:**
   - Documents older than required timeframe
   - Future-dated documents
   - Missing date information

3. **User Interactions:**
   - Rapid file selection changes
   - Navigation during upload
   - Browser refresh during process

4. **Network Conditions:**
   - Failed API calls
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Partial upload failures

5. **Security:**
   - Encryption failures
   - Watermark application errors
   - Token expiration during upload

## Continuous Improvement

### Recommended Additional Tests
1. **Performance Tests:**
   - Large file upload performance
   - Multiple file processing speed
   - Memory usage during encryption

2. **Cross-Browser Tests:**
   - File input behavior across browsers
   - Drag-drop compatibility
   - Canvas rendering differences

3. **Accessibility Tests:**
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - High contrast mode support

4. **Security Tests:**

## Maintenance Notes

- Tests use Vitest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests with multi-browser support
- All tests follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Mock implementations are centralized for easy updates
- Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines
