# Revised Plan for Running Autonomous Agents

Since Claude Code doesn't have a built-in `--agent` flag, here's the practical approach:

## Understanding How Agents Work

1. **Agent Files**: The `.claude/agents/` directory contains markdown files with agent instructions
2. **Manual Context**: You need to provide the agent context when starting Claude
3. **GitHub Monitoring**: Agents will monitor GitHub Issues for tasks

## Practical Setup for Autonomous Agents

### Option 1: Run Claude with Agent Instructions (Manual)

Open 4 terminals and in each, start Claude with specific instructions:

**Terminal 1 - Frontend Engineer:**
```bash
cd /Users/dustinjasmin/eth-1
claude
# Then paste: "You are the clearhold-frontend-engineer agent. Monitor GitHub issues labeled 'frontend' and 'agent-task'. Use [FRONTEND] prefix for all commits."
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend Engineer:**
```bash
cd /Users/dustinjasmin/personal-cryptoscrow-backend
claude
# Then paste: "You are the cryptoescrow-backend-engineer agent. Monitor GitHub issues labeled 'backend' and 'agent-task'. Use [BACKEND] prefix for all commits."
```

**Terminal 3 - Testing Expert:**
```bash
cd /Users/dustinjasmin/eth-1
claude
# Then paste: "You are the clearhold-testing-expert agent. Monitor all repos for testing needs. Use [TEST] prefix for all commits."
```

**Terminal 4 - Security Auditor:**
```bash
cd /Users/dustinjasmin/eth-1
claude
# Then paste: "You are the clearhold-security-auditor agent. Monitor for security issues. Use [SECURITY] prefix for all commits."
```

### Option 2: Use the Task Tool

Since the agent system is built into Claude Code, you can use the Task tool to invoke agents:

```bash
claude
# Then use: Task(description="Monitor frontend tasks", subagent_type="clearhold-frontend-engineer")
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions Only (Semi-Autonomous)

Even without agents running locally, the GitHub Actions will:
1. Detect your commits
2. Create issues automatically
3. Label them for agents
4. Track in the dashboard

You can then manually address the created issues.

## The Reality Check

The true "autonomous" setup requires:
1. **GitHub Actions**: âœ… Already configured to create tasks
2. **Manual Intervention**: You need to check issues and implement solutions
3. **Commit Prefixes**: Use [FRONTEND], [BACKEND], [TEST], [SECURITY] to trigger workflows

## Simplified Workflow

1. **Make changes and commit with prefixes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[FRONTEND] Add new dashboard component"
   git push
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will:**
   - Detect the change
   - Create relevant issues
   - Notify other "agents" (issues for backend, testing, etc.)

3. **You then:**
   - Check the created issues
   - Implement required changes
   - Commit with appropriate prefixes

## Key Points

- The agents are guidance documents, not autonomous programs
- GitHub Actions provide the automation layer
- You act as the "agent" by following the instructions
- The system coordinates work through GitHub Issues and commit messages

## Next Steps

1. **Push the workflows** to enable GitHub Actions
2. **Use commit prefixes** consistently
3. **Monitor GitHub Issues** for created tasks
4. **Follow agent guidelines** when working

This approach gives you:
- Automated task creation
- Clear work organization
- Cross-component coordination
- Progress tracking via dashboard

While not fully autonomous AI agents, this system provides significant automation and organization for your development workflow!
