## Running the Tests

### Integration Tests (Vitest)
```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test tests/integration/

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/integration/kyc-flow.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/kyc/complete-kyc-flow.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run on specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run mobile tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/kyc/kyc-mobile.spec.ts
```

## Test Data Requirements

### Integration Tests
- Uses mocked services and in-memory data
- No external dependencies required
- Automatic cleanup after each test

### E2E Tests
- Requires test fixtures in `/tests/e2e/kyc/fixtures/`
- Admin auth state file for admin tests
- Test images for document upload scenarios

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Configuration
```yaml
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    npm run firebase:emulators &
    npm test tests/integration/
    
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    npm run build
    npm run test:e2e
```

## Coverage Targets
